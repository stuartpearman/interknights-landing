          We sit down one-on-one at a coffee shop and crank out a website and full web presence for your business, the coffee is on us. Here's what this package includes:

        <ul>
          <li>
            One personalized website
          </li>

            As much content for your page as we can complete in one session
          </li>
          <li>
            Consultation on making the most of these tools, climbing the Google search results, and more.p <strong>InterKnights was created to help</strong> those who are unable to pay the premium rates that are so often charged by web development and marketing firms. We realized that in many cases, the cost of a website alone may set a small business back so far that it ends up hurting, rather than helping. The odds are already stacked against the small business owner, so we have made it our mission to tip the scales. The Interknights believe that the web can be a balancing force, and <strong>our mission is to empower all people to grow and flourish</strong> using the greatest tool equal opportunity has ever had, the internet.
